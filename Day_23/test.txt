PIM relies on an underlying topology-gathering protocol to populate a routing table with routes.  This routing table is called the Multicast Routing Information Base (MRIB).  The routes in this table may be taken directly from the unicast routing table, or they may be different and provided by a separate routing protocol such as MBGP [10].  Regardless of how it is created, the primary role of the MRIB in the PIM protocol is to provide the next-hop router along a multicast-capable path to each destination subnet.  The MRIB is used to determine the next-hop neighbor to which any PIM Join/Prune message is sent.  Data flows along the reverse path of the Join messages.  Thus, in contrast to the unicast RIB, which specifies the next hop that a data packet would take to get to some subnet, theMRIB gives reverse-path information and indicates the path that a multicast data packet would take from its origin subnet to the router that has the MRIB.
